# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustic* which means that it includes everything that you could possible do on the project in
relation the curricilum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked of all boxes at the
end of the project.

## Group information

### Question 1
> **Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk>**
>
> Answer:

Group 05

### Question 2
> **Enter the study number for each member in the group**
>
> Answer:

s221937, s222964, s222725, s210703

### Question 3
> **What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We used [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) framework in our project. This framework implements state-of-the-art Machine Learning for Pytorch, and is a good fit for the goals of the project. From this framework we have used pre-trained the [BertForSequenceClassification](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.25.1/en/model_doc/bert#transformers.BertForSequenceClassification)  to achieve our goal. We have started our project by using pre-trained model which help us to focus more implementing on the different techniques taught in the course. we implemented our BERT model to classifies sms text as spam or no spam using [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) where we have specified different parameters like batch size, epoch, optimizer, lr etc. for training our model.   

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development enviroment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:
We used *pip* to install packages and *conda* to create the environment. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using *pipreqs* command which creates the *requirements.txt* file which contains a list of requirements based on imports in the project. We also added missing requirements manually. To get a complete copy of our development environment, the first step is to create a new conda environment (*conda create -n "my_environment python="version"*) and activate it (*conda activate "my_environment*). The project environment was built with Python version 3.10. After that, clone the github project (*git clone https://github.com/lefteriskat/mlops_project.git*) and install everything from the requirements.txt file (*pip install -r requirements.txt*).

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

From the cookiecutter template in the src/data we have filled make_dataset.py, add data.py  we have filled out the data.py, predict_model.py, train_model.py files, and added data.py, model.py. From this directory, we have removed the features and visualization folder including their files. We have added conf.py, Makefile, index.rst, etc. files in the doc folder. We have added .dvc, cloud_app, config, and tests folder with files for implementing DVC, FastAPI, and testing our data and model. Moreover, we also have added different files like train_local_project.dockerfile, train_cloud_project.dockerfile, predict_local_project.dockerfile, traning_in_cloud.sh, cloud_function.py, cloud_build.yaml, etc. for the purpose of building docker image and deploying our model in the cloud environment.        


### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Answer:

We have used flake8, isort and black in our project to ensure code quality and format. For flake8 we give max-line-length = 125 to allow for more explanetory variable name. Those tools are useful in helping to ensure that code is readable, maintainable, and free of errors. They can help to automate some of the tedious and error-prone tasks associated with code development, allowing developers to focus on the more important aspects of the larger project.


## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

For this project, we have implemented 2 tests focusing on the dataset and model. For the dataset we tested that after spliting it into training, validation and testing datasets, the total number of inputs is equal to the total size of the dataset. Model testing ensures that output provided by the model has the desired shaped. Unfortunately, out tests do not cover the training and prediction code.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

The total code coverage of code is 68% which includes dataset and model code. The coverage rate for data script is 84% and for the model script is only 36%. The high percetange for data script was expected because the data script splits the dataset and tokenizes it, so we managed to cover most parts of the code. Since we did not test the training and the prediction code at all and the model checks only one functionality, we expect our code not to detect the errors. Beside code failures, there are many reasons why our project could fail such as wrong dependencies, wrong deployment of the code, not enough permission, corrupted data.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

--- question 9 fill here ---

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

We used dvc to pull data when building **docker** images. Firstly, we store the data into the Google Drive as remote storage solution for our data, but this solution requires to authentic each time we try to either push or pull the data. To solve this problem, we used Google Cloud Storage to store the data into a public bucket which allows us to download the data without being authenticated. The advantage of storing the data into the cloud is that the data is versioned for each experiment by replacing the large files into small metafile. Beside saving disk space on the local machine, also the experiments become reproducible in case the dataset changes. It helps us pull data from the cloud to control user permissions and consistency when building a docker image.

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test**
> **multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of**

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: python my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

We have used hydra to configure our project. It helps to load hyperparameters from a config/folder containing yaml files with hyperparameters for the model, predict and train in separate config files within subfolders. So when the config-files are filled in, the model gets all the necessary hyperparameters from them. For example, the model can be trained by just using the following commad: python src/models/train_model.py


### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:
As we stated in the previous question, we used hydra to keep track of the hyperparameters through config files. Each time the experiment was run, the respective hyperparameters were saved in the folder with the specific data and hour of the experiment. We ensured that our experiments were deterministic, by for example specifing the random seed in Pytroch and random state in the function train_test_split from the sklearn library. We further run an experiment with specified hyperparameters a couple of times and checked that the model weights and biases were the same, implying that we achaived reproducibility of expermintes. 

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**
> **important.**
>
> Answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.
>
> Example:
> *As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.*
> *As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...*
>
> Answer:
We used the weights and biases service, which provieds tools to perform experiment tracking. As seen in the attached screenshot we have tracked the training loss and accuracy across epochs of training the model. Those metrics informed us about the ability of the model to learn patterns present in our data. However, evalution of the model on the training set is not sufficient when considering how well the model would behave on unseen data. To account for that, we have also tracked the validation loss and accuracy across the training process. Those metric informed us how well the model could generalise when deployed. Note, that in the attached screenshot only a couple of runs are present, since many runs were conducted to ensure that the model works as expected and no bugs were introcued. Those runs were left out as not informative for the final presentation. Further, seperate data set was put aside - the test set - and the model, after being trained for predefined number of epochs, was evaluated on it. Unfortunately, this metric is not included in weights and biases report, and one could add it to improve the user overall understanding of the model performance. As could be seen from the figures, the models achieved satisfactory performance after a couple of epochs of training, which is not suprising considering that the pretrained model was used.

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:
Debugging methods varied slightly based on each group member, however we came to the conclusion that in this project the most effective debugging methods were printing different variables, especially when it comes to shapes of tensors, and googling encuntered errors. We used the latter method frequently when working in the services provided by the google cloud. Altough, we did not use a python debugger, we agree that it could be beneficial to incorporate it into our coding practice. Regrettably, we did not profile our code. Doing so would be high on our priority list if we decided to further improve our project.
